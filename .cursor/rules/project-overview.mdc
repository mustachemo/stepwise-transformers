# Stepwise Transformers Learning Project

This project is dedicated to learning about transformers step by step. The goal is to understand transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and implement them from scratch.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code for transformer implementations
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and learning
- `tests/` - Unit tests for transformer components
- `docs/` - Documentation and learning notes
- `data/` - Sample datasets for training and testing

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand attention mechanisms (self-attention, multi-head attention)
2. Implement transformer encoder and decoder blocks
3. Build a complete transformer model from scratch
4. Train and evaluate transformer models
5. Explore different transformer variants (BERT, GPT, etc.)

## Key Concepts to Master
- Positional encoding
- Multi-head attention
- Feed-forward networks
- Layer normalization
- Residual connections
- Tokenization and vocabulary
- Training strategies for transformers

# Debugging and Testing Guide for Transformers

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Attention Weight Issues
**Problem**: Attention weights don't sum to 1 or are all equal
**Solutions**:
- Check softmax implementation
- Verify attention score scaling (divide by âˆšd_k)
- Ensure proper masking for decoder
- Test with simple examples first

### 2. Gradient Flow Problems
**Problem**: Gradients are exploding or vanishing
**Solutions**:
- Verify residual connections are properly implemented
- Check layer normalization placement
- Use gradient clipping during training
- Initialize weights properly

### 3. Positional Encoding Issues
**Problem**: Model doesn't learn positional information
**Solutions**:
- Verify sinusoidal encoding implementation
- Check that positional encoding is added (not concatenated)
- Test with simple position-aware tasks
- Visualize positional encoding patterns

### 4. Memory Issues
**Problem**: Out of memory errors during training
**Solutions**:
- Reduce batch size
- Use gradient accumulation
- Implement attention caching
- Use mixed precision training

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Each Component
```python
def test_attention_weights_sum_to_one():
    """Test that attention weights sum to 1 for each position."""

def test_positional_encoding_properties():
    """Test positional encoding has expected properties."""

def test_masking_prevents_future_access():
    """Test that masking prevents looking at future tokens."""

def test_residual_connections():
    """Test that residual connections preserve gradient flow."""
```

### Integration Tests
```python
def test_encoder_block():
    """Test complete encoder block with simple input."""

def test_decoder_block():
    """Test complete decoder block with masking."""

def test_full_transformer():
    """Test complete transformer with simple sequence."""
```

## Debugging Tools

### Attention Visualization
```python
def visualize_attention(attention_weights, tokens):
    """Visualize attention weights for debugging."""
    # Implementation for attention heatmap
```

### Gradient Flow Analysis
```python
def check_gradient_flow(model):
    """Check gradient flow through the model."""
    # Implementation for gradient analysis
```

### Memory Profiling
```python
def profile_memory_usage(model, input_data):
    """Profile memory usage during forward pass."""
    # Implementation for memory profiling
```

## Common Debugging Patterns

### 1. Start Simple
- Test with single attention head
- Use small sequence lengths
- Test with simple tasks (copy, reverse)

### 2. Verify Each Component
- Test attention mechanism in isolation
- Verify positional encoding separately
- Test feed-forward network independently

### 3. Check Mathematical Correctness
- Verify attention formula implementation
- Check softmax numerical stability
- Ensure proper scaling

### 4. Monitor Training
- Track loss during training
- Monitor gradient norms
- Check attention weight distributions
- Visualize model predictions

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Efficient Attention
- Use optimized attention implementations
- Implement attention caching
- Use sparse attention when possible

### 2. Memory Optimization
- Use gradient checkpointing
- Implement efficient data loading
- Use mixed precision training

### 3. Training Optimization
- Use learning rate warmup
- Implement proper weight initialization
- Use label smoothing
- Add dropout for regularization

## Error Messages and Solutions

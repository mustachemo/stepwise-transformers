# Stepwise Transformers Learning TUI

This project is dedicated to learning about transformers step by step through an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) built with Textual. The goal is to create an educational application that guides users through transformer concepts, implementations, and experiments.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code for transformer implementations and TUI components
- `tui/` - Textual TUI application and screens
- `tests/` - Unit tests for transformer components and TUI
- `docs/` - Documentation and learning notes
- `data/` - Sample datasets for training and testing
- `examples/` - Interactive examples and demonstrations

## Learning Objectives
1. Build an interactive TUI for learning transformers
2. Implement transformer components with live visualization
3. Create interactive tutorials and experiments
4. Provide real-time model training and evaluation
5. Enable hands-on exploration of transformer concepts
